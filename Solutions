# Q 1:
      since here inner and outer loops afre independent from each other
      so we can multiplay their individual TCs to get final TC.
      for T1 = O(n)
      for inner loop :
          j<n^(1/2)
        so T1 = O(n^(1/2)
      Therefore TC = T1*T2
      So TC = O(n^(3/2))
# Q 2:
      since here inner and outer loops are independent from each other
      so we can multiplay their individual TCs to get final TC.
      for T1 = O(n)
      for inner loop :
        so by using the formula of GP we can say T2 = O(log n)
      Therefore TC = T1*T2
      So TC = O(nlog n)
# Q 3:
      since here inner and outer loops are independent from each other
      so we can multiplay their individual TCs to get final TC.
      for T1 = O(n)
      for inner loop :
          j<n^(1/2)
        so by using the formula of GP we can say T2 =O((log n)/2) = O(log n)
      Therefore TC = T1*T2
      So TC = O(nlog n)
# Q 4:
      For outer loop :
            i = n, n/2, n/2^2 ,...,2, 1
            it is similar to reverse of this like -> i = 1,2,4,8,...,n/2, n 
            Now inner loop will run i times for each value of i :
            so no. of opereation = 1+2+4+8+ ...+n/2 + n
            now add & subtract 1 then  no. of opereation = 2*n-1
            so TC = O(n)
# Q 5:
      for in outer loop i will take this values:
          1,2,4,8,...,n
      now by using inner loop we can say no. of operation = (n-1) + (n-2) +(n-4) +(n-8) +...+(n-n/2)+(n-n)
        = n*n -(2*n-1)
      so TC = O(n^2)
